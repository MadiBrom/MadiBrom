### Unreal story game project

A room-based story game in Unreal with a fixed camera per room, tiny interactions, and a cozy feel. Think gentle exploration, light puzzles, and tactile feedback. No stress, just vibe.

**Vision**  
* Fixed camera rooms with smart cuts between views  
* Small interactions that feel physical  
* Environmental story bits that unfold as you explore  
* Minimal or no combat  
* Pixel-flavored look with modern lighting

**Core loop**  
* Enter a room  
* Observe the space and listen  
* Interact with an object or two  
* Unlock a small story beat and a new path

**Tech plan**  
* Unreal Engine five with a Blueprint first approach  
* Third-person template trimmed to a simpler controller  
* CineCameraActors for fixed views and shot changes  
* Interactable system with a base blueprint and child actors  
* Save system with SaveGame objects  
* Pixel look via a post-process material and lower render target scale

**Current status**  
* Third-person project set with a simple room and walls  
* Character control working and camera experiments in place  
* Early post-process test for a pixel feel  
* First interactable prototype in progress  
* Basic nav mesh and collision clean up started

**Next milestones**  
* Input mapping pass and clean controller  
* Interactable base class with prompts and focus  
* Room loader plus save and load for state  
* First lighting pass and sound pass  
* Tiny vertical slice with one room, two interactions, one story beat
